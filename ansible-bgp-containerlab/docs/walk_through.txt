Automation container defined in Dockerfile.automaiton -> 
-custom image from python 3.11-slim with additional linux system pkgs, python pkgs
-ansible collections for frr 
-git clone and compiling gbgp api / library stubs and data structures,
-setting /workspace as default entry dir 



****Entry Point is setup.sh****

-First checks if the image for the automation container is built, builds if not 

-Destroys lab containers and mounted dirs, deploys fresh lab with topology.yml 

	topology.yml defines the network devices

		-sets Mgmt network
		-each endpoint gets 
			-image
			-mgmt ip
		-initial configurations for for
			-enabling bgp and zebra daemons
			-executes frrinit.sh, passes start
			-using http for apk pkgs, filter agent at BOCES provides its own SSL certs, 							
			too messy
			-configures ssh login
		-initial configurations for gobgp
			-starting bgp daemon with no config (-f /dev/null)
			-debug level logging for verbosity and plain text logs
			-starts gRPC server on 50051

-Calls create_links.sh for data plane 


	create_links.sh, series of docker network commands

		-cleans up networks and links form previous runs
		-creates links, networks, assigned ips for gbgp to frr, and networks behind them 
		-delete default routes on hosts to default gateway and add default routes on the 			
		hosts pointing to frr and gbgp respectively  
		

-Runs apline container in gobgp namespace
	-enables ipv4 forwarding in the kernel and adds route to network behind frr via its interface 	
	directly connected to frr 

	-needed separate container because gobgp image is only the daemon with no shell
		

-Copies files from host to automation container (docker cp <file> <image-name:/dir/>)

	-configure_gobgp.py
	-config_playbook.yml
	-inventory.yml
	-prepare_user.sh (and chmod +x from within automation container)
-Adds frr ip to known hosts in automation so ansible frr module can connect (redundant)



****** config_playbook.yml is called from the automation container***

-Run configure_gobgp.py
	-using packages and stubs compiled in the automation image
	defined in the Dockerfile.automation
	-conencts gRPC server on 50051 of gobgp1 mgmt ip
	-setting router ID, AS number and frr1 mgtm ip as neighbor ip
	-next hop ip is gobgp1 data plane ip
	-advertises 10.1.0.0/24 network prefix
	-import/export policy is configured to accept all routes
	-adds policy assignment to import and export policies for neighbor route exchange
	-adds path to global RIB (Route Information Base, BGP routing table)
	-coonstructing bgp attributes from compiled api structure


-Run prepare_frr_user.sh, ansbile needs specifally configured user
	-vtysh shell is the cisco like CLI for frr
	-helper function to execute all bash commands in one SSH session
	-add frr users to existing frrvty group (group created in the frr image)
	-sets vtysh as default shell for frr user so when ansbile connects 
	as that user the interface is ready to accept the cli commands
	under the hood af the ansbile frr module
	-create vtysh and bgp conf files, chown and chmod to frr user
	-start the bgp daemon 

-Run ansible frr bgp module (frr.frr.frr_bgp)
	-sets AS num, router ID
	-advertizes 10.2.0.0/24 network to frr, next hop is gobgp1 data plane ip
	-configures route-map to permit all routes
