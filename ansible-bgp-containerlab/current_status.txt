Enabling route forward in gobgp kernel is done in setup scripts with hardcoded
routes. I'm not sure where to do this work. If i want the lab to be set up dynamically based 
on inventory / topolgy, 

if i create a custom  docker image, i wont be able to read the vlaues from invetory to tell gobgp what
routes to put in its table based on arg passed to setup scripts. setup scripts look for the built image 


i could buil the imag dynamically with the proper routes in the table each time i run set up 

i could delegate the apline helper into createlinks running from the automaion container, which would be a container runing in a contianer 
being managed by the docker desktop vm. its getting ridiculous and im not focusing on actual netowkring
